# Encryption_program
It is a Encryption program that encrypt messages.
I don't know it might stupid, but i love doing it.
Basically this program takes strings as a input and give output after a long process.
you have give two keys, suppose those are- 1 and 4
First it convert the given string to binary and after that it shift the first 0 to 1 step and second zero to 2 step
and it shift the first '1' to 4 step and second '1' to 5 step and so on. :D
